[Throwback] in Active Directory lab that teaches the fundamentals and core concepts of attacking a Windows network. The network simulates a realistic corporate environment that has several attack vectors you would expect to find in todayâ€™s organisations.

# Enumeration

The initial network scope looks like this:
![image of initial network map](/assets/img/posts/throwback/network_layout.webp)

Using nmap for initial enumeration, I discovered 3 of the in-scope machines and their open ports, as well as the name of the domain that they're apart of.

**Command**
```shell
nmap -sV -sC -p- -v 10.200.29.0/24 --min-rate 5000
```

## Throwback FW01
---
Going to the firewall's web interface, it confirmed that it is running **pfsense**, which has an administrator login.

![pfsense login page](/assets/img/posts/throwback/1_pfsense_login_page.webp)

### Logging In

However, the default crededntials were never changed and therefore, I was able to simply login to the panel using the  default credentials `admin:pfsense`.

![logged in to pfsense panel](/assets/img/posts/throwback/2_pfsense_admin.webp)

### Reverse Shell

Then, after poking around what the panel has to offer, I found a diagnostics page (under Diagonistics > Command Prompt), which conveniently allowed for code execution in both bash shell and PHP form, as well as file upload and download. So naturally, I executed [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) PHP reverse shell in the interface, opened a listener on my machine, and got root access to THROWBACK-FW01. That was easy.

![php reverse shell in diagnostics tab](/assets/img/posts/throwback/3_pfsense_phprs.webp)

![reverse shell from my machine](/assets/img/posts/throwback/4_pfsense_root.webp)

### Flags

Using the following command, I was able to find search for .txt files on the machine to find the flags.

```shell
find / -iname "*.txt" 2>&1
```

This way, I found flags 3 and 4.

![flags 3 and 4](/assets/img/posts/throwback/5_fw01_flags.webp)

### Credentials

Also in `/var/logs/` I found the unusual log `login.log`, which contained encrypted credentials to a user **HumphreyW**.

![humphreyws credentials in login.log](/assets/img/posts/throwback/6_humphreyw_creds.webp)

His password was easily cracked using [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/)

![humphreyws cracked password](/assets/img/posts/throwback/7_humphrey_cracked.webp)

And thats all I was able to get out of this machine for now.
